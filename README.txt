The file Design.algorithm.R contains the programmes implement the design of the group sequential trial using MERT. 
Besides, it involves the programmes for the Monte Carlo simulation.
The folders named after the identication number of the tables and figures store the scenario code, the simulation data and the code used for draw figures and tables. However, the files of table 2 was uploaded separately due to the limit of the uploading size.
The folder Supplementary Figures contain the code and data for Figure A1 and A2
